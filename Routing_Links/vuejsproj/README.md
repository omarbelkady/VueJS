## Routing Links
```
Step 1: Create a new component called header.vue that will directly route me to the appropriate link when I supply
it in the url

Step 2: use the tag <router-link> which is provided by vue-router which is better because it captures
the click event which doesn't reload the page in contrast to using the anchor tag
the router link takes an attribute called to and I give it the value of whatever url I want to goto

Step 3: Use the exact keyword to make sure to turn the links active whenever we goto them and turn all
the other links innactive when we are not on the route
