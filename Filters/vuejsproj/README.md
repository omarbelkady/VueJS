## Filters
```
A Filter is used to change the output of data to the browser. For example I have the title and body outputted to the browser.
I can change for example the output of the title from lowercase to uppercase. Filters do not however change the data directly
wherever they are stored. The only thing we change is the way they output to the browser. To use a filter all you have to do is
to add a pipe to the end of the data and tack on the filter name.

Remember after I created my filter I must register it in similar to how I did with components I register my filter in my main.js file
