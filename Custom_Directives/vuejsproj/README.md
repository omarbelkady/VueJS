## Custom Directives
```
Directives are a way for me to tell vuejs to do something aka to exhibit some form of behavior for me.
The below directives all share one thing in common they all start with v- and we add them to html attributes
Sometimes the direcive I want VueJS is not prebuilt in VueJS.

Remember Directives have lifecycle hooks too
```

Some examples of directives: 
- v-if
- v-on
- v-for
- v-model
