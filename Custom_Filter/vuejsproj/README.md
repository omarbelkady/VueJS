## Custom Search Filters
```
A Filter as discussed before is used to change the output/display of data to the browser. VueJS strongly 
discourages using filters to search for a particular item in our data instead it recommends to use a 
computed property. The first thing to do obviously is to create a search field(using an input tag) so 
that when the user enters some type of data intended to search for it we can find it within our data.
