## HTTP Requests ---> GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
```
Sometimes just having content printed is not what we simply want in our application. We want the content to be moved
around or we want to work with the data like store it in a database.

In VueJS there are many ways to perform HTTP Requests some ways are: JQuery or FetchAPI. we can another resource called vue resource
```

```bash
npm install vue-resource
```
